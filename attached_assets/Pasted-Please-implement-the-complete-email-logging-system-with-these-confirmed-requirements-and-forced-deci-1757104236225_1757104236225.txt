Please implement the complete email logging system with these confirmed requirements and forced decisions:

- Database Schema:
  - Use `recipient_email` consistently (standardized naming).
  - Fields: id (PK), recipient_email, product_id (nullable FK), subject, preview_html, status, sg_message_id, sent_at, updated_at.
  - product_id must always be nullable; only populated for product-related emails.

- SendGrid Service:
  - Capture sg_message_id from the response body (not headers).
  - Always insert a new row into email_logs when sendEmail() is called with status = "pending".

- Webhook Handler:
  - Create `/webhook/sendgrid` route.
  - Accept SendGrid event POSTs without authentication for now (forced decision).
  - Add a TODO with code comment for signature validation later.
  - Update email_logs status based on events: pending, sent, delivered, bounced, opened, clicked, spam_reported.

- Admin Interface:
  - Update email logs page to show recipient_email, subject, status, sent_at, and preview_html.
  - Allow sorting/filtering by most recent.
  - Ensure clear inline comments explaining what each part of the UI does.

- Code Commenting and Documentation (new requirement):
  - Add inline comments in migrations, backend routes, and sendEmail service functions explaining what the code is doing and why.
  - Add a top-level comment block for each major file (`sendgridService.ts`, `/webhook/sendgrid` handler, admin-email-logs.tsx) describing:
    - The purpose of the file
    - How it fits into the email logging system
    - What future maintainers should look out for
  - Mark all TODOs (like webhook signature validation) clearly in comments.

- Goal:
  - Local logs always created on send.
  - Status updated later when SendGrid webhook fires.
  - Admins can see both the attempt and the final status.
  - The code is self-explanatory with clear comments, so future maintainers can understand the flow quickly.

Implement migrations, backend updates, admin UI changes, and ensure code is thoroughly commented.
