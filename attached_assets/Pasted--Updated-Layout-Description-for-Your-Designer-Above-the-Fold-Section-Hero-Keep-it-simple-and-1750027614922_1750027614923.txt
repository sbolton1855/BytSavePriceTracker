✅ Updated Layout Description (for Your Designer)
🔷 Above-the-Fold Section (Hero)
Keep it simple and focused — this is your first impression.

Suggested Layout:

Left Side: Headline, tagline, search input

Headline: Track Amazon Prices

Subheadline: Enter a product name or link to set alerts for price drops.

Search box with icon: labeled clearly as “Search by Product Name”

Add a toggle or hint below: Looking to track by URL or ASIN? Use Quick Track →

Right Side: Illustration or animation (shopping cart, money-saving icon, etc.)

Purpose: break text overload and increase visual interest

🟨 Quick Track (Current Yellow Box)
Currently it looks like a fallback, but feels clunky.

Updated Presentation:

Collapse it by default with a toggle: “Want to paste a link instead? Click to expand”

Move it below the search section, not beside it

Keep it minimal and clean — like a one-line accordion form

📊 Price Drop Dashboard
Visually dominant right now. Push it down the page.

Suggested Treatment:

Label it clearly: “Your Recent Alerts” or “Active Price Watches”

Style it more like a feed: Card list with cleaner padding, inline price-change badges (e.g. -43%, +$2.50)

Optional: Add a “History” tab if you want room for past alert logs

🧾 How It Works Section
Too generic and buried. Let's make it visual and trust-building.

Revise this into a 3‑column benefit section:

Step 1: “Search or paste a product” → icon of magnifying glass

Step 2: “Set your target price” → target/bullseye icon

Step 3: “Get notified when it drops” → email alert icon

Add a “Trusted by” section or logos if you have partners or beta users.

🎯 Overall Style Suggestions
Spacing: Increase whitespace between modules—everything’s feeling too tight vertically.

Font Hierarchy: Use different font weights/sizes to guide the eye. Right now, all headings feel equal.

Consistency: Avoid repeating “Search & Track” in multiple places. Choose one and stick with it.

CTA Buttons: Make “Track a Product” prominent with icon → emphasize action.

Final UI Goals
Cleaner visual hierarchy

Stronger first impression

Better separation between “Search”, “Track by URL”, and “Your Alerts”

More onboarding clarity (“what do I do first?” is fuzzy right now)
