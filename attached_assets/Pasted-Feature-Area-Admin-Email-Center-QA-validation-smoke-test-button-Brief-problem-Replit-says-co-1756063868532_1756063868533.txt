Feature/Area:
Admin Email Center — QA validation + smoke test button

Brief problem:
Replit says “complete.” I need a fast way to verify it actually works end-to-end (preview → send → logs) without bouncing between pages.

Fix requirements:

Add a “Run QA Smoke Test” to Email Center

Location: Email Center → Settings sub-tab

Inputs:
• Test recipient email (default from settings field)
• Template select (default “price-drop”)

Action flow when clicked:
a) Preview API: GET /api/admin/email/preview/:id (expect 200 with subject/html)
b) Send test: POST /api/admin/send-test-email { email, templateId }
c) Poll email logs: GET /api/admin/email-logs?isTest=true&pageSize=1 every 2s up to 20s
d) If a new row appears with matching recipient + templateId, show ✅ success; else show ❌ failure with last error

Show a compact step-by-step status UI (Preview ✓, Send ✓, Log ✓)

Auto-preview on selection (quality of life)

In Templates sub-tab, when a template is selected, automatically fetch preview (no extra click)

Logs sub-tab auto-refresh

While Logs sub-tab is active, auto-refetch every 5s (pause on tab switch)

Wire all API calls with unified auth

Use AdminAuth.getToken() and send x-admin-token header

No additional login prompts

Acceptance criteria:

Settings → Run QA Smoke Test completes with ✅ within 20s and writes a new isTest=true row

Templates sub-tab renders preview immediately when selecting a template

Logs sub-tab refreshes every 5s and shows newest first

No console errors; all network calls 200 with valid token

Quick tests to run:

/admin/email-center?sub=templates → select “Price Drop” → preview appears automatically

/admin/email-center?sub=send → send a test → success toast

/admin/email-center?sub=logs → see latest row

/admin/email-center?sub=settings → Run QA Smoke Test → all three steps show ✓ and a new log row appears

Notes/constraints:

Do not change backend routes

Keep styling consistent with AdminTabNav/AdminSubTabNav

Polling should stop on success or after timeout
